# Create React App Project

## Introduction
This project is a front-end web application bootstrapped with **Create React App**, a popular tool for setting up React projects with a pre-configured build system. It provides a development environment for building single-page applications using **React**, with support for hot reloading, testing, and optimized production builds.

- **Source Code**: Located in the `src` folder, containing React components and application logic.
- **Build Output**: Generated in the `build` folder for production deployment.
- **Scripts**: Pre-configured npm scripts for development, testing, and building (`npm start`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm run eject`).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)  
- **Framework**: React  
- **Build Tool**: Create React App (includes Webpack, Babel, ESLint)  
- **Port**: Default port `3000` for development server  

---

## Prerequisites

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app.git
cd create-react-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables (Optional)
Create a `.env` file in the project root to customize the development server port or other settings:
```bash
PORT=3000
```

### 4. Run the Development Server
```bash
npm start
```
This starts the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload automatically when you make changes.

## Usage
Access the application via the development server:
- **Development URL**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Available Scripts
- **Start Development Server**:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  Runs the app in development mode with hot reloading.

- **Run Tests**:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
  Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

- **Build for Production**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, optimized and minified.

- **Eject Configuration**:
  ```bash
  npm run eject
  ```
  Exposes Webpack, Babel, and other configurations for full customization (one-way operation).
